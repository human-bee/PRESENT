/**
 * TODO: This is the canvas agent that will be used to control the canvas via tldraw sdk and editor api calls.
 * 
 * To emulate how teach.tldraw.com works, you would need a system that integrates a large language model (LLM) 
 * with a canvas library, focusing on allowing the LLM to directly manipulate the canvas.
 * 
 * Here's a breakdown:
 * 
 * Canvas Environment: You'd need a robust, web-based canvas library (like Tldraw) that allows for programmatic 
 * creation and manipulation of shapes, lines, and text.
 * 
 * Visual Input for AI: The AI needs to "see" the current state of the canvas. This means converting the visual 
 * information of the canvas (shapes, positions, colors, relationships) into a format the AI can understand, 
 * often through a vision model or a structured text description of the canvas's elements.
 * 
 * Natural Language Interface: Users provide commands in plain text (e.g., "draw a house," "make it red").
 * 
 * AI (LLM) as an Agent: The core idea is that the AI acts as an agent, not just a generator. It receives the 
 * user's command and the canvas's current state. Based on this, it decides on a sequence of actions.
 * 
 * Action Output: The AI's output isn't a final image, but rather instructions or commands that translate 
 * directly into actions within the canvas library's API (e.g., "create a circle at X,Y," "change color of 
 * shape Z to red," "move shape A to B"). The video mentions the AI using "the same tools that a human uses" 
 * (6:47), implying it uses these programmatic commands.
 * 
 * Execute Actions: These AI-generated actions are then executed by the canvas library, updating the visual 
 * display in real-time.
 * 
 * Iterative Process: The process is iterative; the AI can make changes, receive new prompts based on the 
 * updated canvas, and continue to modify the drawing.
 * 
 * In essence, you're teaching an AI to operate a drawing program by giving it the program's functions as 
 * its "hands" and the canvas's state as its "eyes."
