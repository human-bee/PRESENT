Let me try to explain how hard it is to get to that level. Two weeks into the league, people are literally staying up 40–50 hours without sleeping, just playing Path of Exile.

You start at a node, then go to adjacent, connected maps. But Elon’s just clicking a map that’s not in the chain—just clicking it over and over, not eligible to enter.
